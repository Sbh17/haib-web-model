## Backend Migration Preparation

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set up environment variables for GCP/Firebase
- [ ] Configure API endpoints in `src/config/api.ts`
- [ ] Update environment settings in `src/config/environment.ts`

### Required Environment Variables for Migration

#### For Firebase Backend:
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_FUNCTIONS_URL=https://us-central1-your_project.cloudfunctions.net
```

#### For GCP Backend:
```env
VITE_GCP_PROJECT_ID=your_gcp_project_id
VITE_GCP_REGION=us-central1
VITE_GCP_ENDPOINT=https://your-service.run.app
```

#### For Custom Backend:
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.com/api
```

## Database Schema Requirements

The backend should implement these entities:

### Core Tables
1. **Users/Profiles**
   - id, email, name, phone, role, avatar, bio, preferences
   
2. **Salons**
   - id, name, description, address, location, rating, ownerId, status
   
3. **Services**
   - id, name, description, price, duration, salonId, categoryId
   
4. **Appointments**
   - id, userId, salonId, serviceId, workerId, date, status, notes
   
5. **Reviews**
   - id, userId, salonId, appointmentId, rating, comment
   
6. **Promotions**
   - id, salonId, title, description, discount, startDate, endDate
   
7. **News**
   - id, title, content, image, date, category

### API Endpoints Required

#### Authentication
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/register
- POST /auth/logout
- GET /auth/profile
- PUT /auth/profile

#### Salons
- GET /salons
- GET /salons/:id
- GET /salons/nearby?lat=&lng=&radius=
- POST /salons (admin/owner)
- PUT /salons/:id (admin/owner)
- DELETE /salons/:id (admin)

#### Services
- GET /services
- GET /salons/:salonId/services
- POST /services (admin/owner)
- PUT /services/:id (admin/owner)
- DELETE /services/:id (admin/owner)

#### Appointments
- GET /appointments (user's appointments)
- POST /appointments
- PUT /appointments/:id
- DELETE /appointments/:id

#### Reviews
- GET /salons/:salonId/reviews
- POST /reviews
- PUT /reviews/:id
- DELETE /reviews/:id

#### Admin
- GET /admin/dashboard
- GET /admin/users
- GET /admin/salon-requests
- GET /admin/analytics

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Frontend Deployment
- [ ] Build the React application: `npm run build`
- [ ] Deploy to your preferred hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- [ ] Configure custom domain if needed

### 2. Backend Migration
- [ ] Dockerize your Node.js/Express backend
- [ ] Set up GCP Cloud Run or Firebase Functions
- [ ] Migrate database to Cloud SQL or Firestore
- [ ] Set up authentication (Firebase Auth or custom)
- [ ] Configure file storage (Cloud Storage or Firebase Storage)

### 3. Configuration Updates
- [ ] Update environment variables in deployment
- [ ] Test all API endpoints
- [ ] Verify authentication flow
- [ ] Test file upload functionality
- [ ] Validate real-time features (if applicable)

### 4. Post-Migration Testing
- [ ] User registration and login
- [ ] Salon search and filtering
- [ ] Appointment booking flow
- [ ] Payment processing (if implemented)
- [ ] Admin panel functionality
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Performance testing

## Security Considerations
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] CORS configuration
- [ ] Authentication middleware
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] File upload security
- [ ] Environment variables security

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] API response caching
- [ ] Image optimization
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] CDN setup for static assets
- [ ] Monitoring and logging

## Notes for Backend Developer
- The frontend expects JSON responses for all API calls
- File uploads should return the file URL in the response
- Authentication should use JWT tokens
- Real-time features can be implemented with WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
- The app currently uses mock data in `src/services/mockData.ts` - replace with actual API calls
